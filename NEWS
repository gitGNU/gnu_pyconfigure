* 0.1.1
This is a bugfix/cleanup release, correcting several problems with
version 0.1 
** Running Autoconf no longer produces errant files.
There was a bug in the Python Autoconf macros which produced empty
files. This has been corrected.
** Python syntax errors in some macros were fixed.
** The `src' directory was cleaned up.
Previously, pre-generated files were included in the src
directory. This has been cleaned up in favor of the developer
generating them him or herself.
** The `bootstrap.sh' script was added
The `bootstrap.sh' script can be executed in place of `autoreconf'
(so the developer need not know about `autoreconf').
** PKG-INFO.in has been expanded to show more default classifiers
* 0.1
This is the first release of pyconfigure
