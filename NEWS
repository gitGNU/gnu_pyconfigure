* 0.2.2
This release is a bugfix release fixing a critical bug in the Python
M4 macros.

** pkgpythondir and pkgpyexecdir are correctly constructed
In some cases, the package name was not being appended to these
variables, which could have some nasty effects if used blindly.  This
has been fixed.

* 0.2.1
This is a bugfix release.

** The "install-dirs" target of Makefile.in was fixed
Directory expansion in the "install-dirs" target did not work
correctly, which has been fixed. Also, some erroneous references to an
"installdirs" target were fixed.

** More default files were added to DISTFILES in Makefile.in
Some important files were missing from the default list of files to be
included in source distributions.

** Multi-line package descriptions in PKG-INFO files are properly parsed.
The so-called "folded field" format (RFC-822) of multi-line package
descriptions is properly handled by the pyconf script.

** Compatibility of the pyconf script was improved.
The intention is for the pyconf script to be run-able via Python 2
or 3. Further language differences were caught and fixed to improve
this compatibility.

** The Autoconf macros were cleaned up and improved.
Several small bugs were fixed in the Autoconf macros, including:

- Version checking properly handles the release level.  This fixes a
  bug in checking that the interpreter is correctly less-than-or-equal
  to its actual version.

- Version checking results are displayed on the same line as the
  check.  Previously, the results were printed on a new line.

- AC_PROG_PYTHON was renamed to PC_PROG_PYTHON.  This macro belongs in
  the pyconfigure "PC_" namespace.

- PC_PROG_PYTHON now does basic version checking.  You may pass a
  minimum and maximum version to PC_PROG_PYTHON, which it uses to
  build a list of interpreters to search for. For example, if the
  minimum version is 2.7, the interpreter "python27" will be added to
  the list of executables to search for.

- The running of test programs in the macros was fixed for greater
  compatibility.  This fixes possible bugs in running some of the
  Autoconf macros.

* 0.2
This release introduces a major restructuring of pyconfigure, making
it easier to use for projects with different needs. Please read the
documentation to learn more about the changes.

** The new 'pyconf' script makes starting a new project easier.
Previously, pyconfigure's template files had to be manually copied
into new projects.  Now this process is simplified by the 'pyconf'
script that is installed with pyconfigure.  This script is called
from within a Python project's directory and copies/generates all of
the necessary files into the directory for you.  Its command-line
options support several different project needs.

** Writing your build/install logic in Make is now supported.
In addition to having the Makefile be a wrapper around setup.py, it
is now possible to do the opposite and have setup.py be a wrapper
around the Makefile.  This allows you to write all of your build and
install logic in Make.

** The template files contain more comments.
Many of the template files have been filled with even more useful
comments, making the process of setting up pyconfigure for your
project even easier. Also, the 'configure.ac' template has been
rearranged into a more logical structure.

** The new PC_INIT Autoconf macro simplifies getting started.
This macro makes finding a Python interpreter even easier and more
flexible by letting you specify minimum and maximum versions, freeing
you from having to write this version checking code yourself in
'configure.ac'.

** The PC_PYTHON_VERIFY_VERSION macro has been made more flexible.
Of course, if you *do* want to do some kind of version checking, it
has been made even easier. You can now perform any kind of version
test with PC_PYTHON_VERIFY_VERSION: greater-than, less-than, equals,
etc.

* 0.1.1
This is a bugfix/cleanup release, correcting several problems with
version 0.1 

** Running Autoconf no longer produces errant files.
There was a bug in the Python Autoconf macros which produced empty
files. This has been corrected.

** Python syntax errors in some macros were fixed.

** The `src' directory was cleaned up.
Previously, pre-generated files were included in the src
directory. This has been cleaned up in favor of the developer
generating them him or herself.

** The `bootstrap.sh' script was added
The `bootstrap.sh' script can be executed in place of `autoreconf'
(so the developer need not know about `autoreconf').

** PKG-INFO.in has been expanded to show more default classifiers

* 0.1
This is the first release of pyconfigure
