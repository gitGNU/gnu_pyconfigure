pyconfigure 0.1
--------------------

pyconfigure provides a means to easily manage the configuration
and installation of Python programs with the familiar GNU standard
installation procedure:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $ make
    $ make install

Of course, since Python programs usually do not need to be compiled,
the second step can be eliminated.

Currently, pyconfigure is designed to live alongside the
traditional Python distutils (`setup.py') method, providing a wrapper
around its functionality. Future releases might optionally allow
developers to work independently of distutils altogether.

To use pyconfigure, you can simply drop the files from the src/
directory into your Python project. Without modification, they provide
a basic wrapper around setup.py that allows one to install to the
chosen prefix. It allows one optionally to install the application to
a virtualenv with the --with-virtualenv configure argument. It would
be advisable at least to modify the configure.ac script to reflect
your project's name and then run:

    $ autoreconf -fvi

Several Autoconf macros are provided in the m4 directory which can be
used to perform a variety of tests during the configuration stage,
from verifying a minimum Python version to running test programs. See
the included documentation for more info and browse through the
provided sample Autoconf script (`configure.ac') for well-commented
examples.

pyconfigure is official GNU software and is released under the aegis
of GNU.
